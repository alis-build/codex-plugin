# Alis Build — DBD refresher

Read referenced support tickets before proposing changes:
`alis specialist get tickets/ID --json`. Given only a title, use
`alis specialist tickets --state all --json`, match it, then get the ID. Ask
which ticket if several match, or ask for the ID if none match. `support` is an
alias; `list` lists people. Specialists may use `tickets --inbox --json` for a
staff-inbox reference. Read full results and distinguish access errors from
missing commands; an empty filtered help search proves neither.

Define, Build, Deploy. Protobuf contracts live in the org's define repo
(`~/alis.build/<org>/define`); Define pins the contract to a pushed commit and generates
language packages plus platform artifacts (Spanner protobundles, Pub/Sub topics). Go
services (neurons) live in product build repos (`~/alis.build/<org>/build/<product>`);
Build runs from the latest *pushed* commit — commit and push before building. Deploy
provisions the runtime (Cloud Run plus supporting resources) from the neuron's Terraform
under `infra/`; validate via the generated playground.

## Execute through the `alis` CLI

`alis define <pkg> --json --install` · `alis build <pkg> --json --deploy -e <env>` ·
`alis deploy <pkg> --json` · `alis packages install|upgrade|add <pkg> --json`. The CLI is
self-documenting: `alis docs` and `alis <cmd> --help` are the source of truth. Under
`--json`, stdout is ONE final JSON object; progress is NDJSON on stderr — never merge
`2>&1` into a JSON parser. Never poll with `sleep` loops: block with
`alis operations wait <op> --json`. Never hand-edit dependency pins (`sed` on go.mod) or
hand-roll package-manager environments — `alis packages` handles the private registries
and credentials for you. The working directory is the context — after `alis service new`,
pass its `buildFolder` as the tool working directory before continuing. When a conversation
references an Ideate project (`ideas/<id>`), run `alis ideate context <id>` first.

`can't reach alis.build` or DNS failure in a restricted sandbox: rerun the same standalone
command with network permission once. If it still fails, inspect connectivity and the
platform response. Set the tool's workdir separately; do not chain, pipe, or redirect
network CLI calls. Prefer `--async` and retain its operation name. `unknown flag: --json` on a DBD command or
a `Log in now? (y|n)` prompt means an older `alis` binary answered: `which -a alis`, report,
stop.

If a local build cannot download private Alis packages, first run
`alis packages install <pkg> --language go --json` (select the relevant language).
Do not reconstruct registry settings from Dockerfiles or shell history. Install
can tidy manifests and lockfiles and fetches the service's latest definition;
use `--version <version>` when intentionally preserving a specific definition
version. Inspect any remaining error before further recovery; never bypass TLS.

## Skills are native

The plugin's `discover` skill routes platform-shaped work to registry skills — quietly and
local-first: probe `alis skills suggest "<outcome>" --json`; load only on a distinctive
match (`distinctive` ≥ 3); no match means no skill and no narration. Generic coding
(Makefiles, ordinary bugs, tests, git) needs no discovery even inside a workspace. A loaded
skill owns execution. After solving something new by hand, the user can say "capture this
as a skill" and the plugin's `capture` skill saves it for their team.

Production changes require explicit approval of the exact version or pushed commit,
target environments and branch override. Present the CLI's pinned retry for approval,
then execute it with `--confirm-production` and verify its operation. Keep approved
arguments unchanged. Session modes, `--approve` and broad task intent grant no consent.

Run one standalone Alis command per shell-tool call: no pipes, output trimming or redirects.
Read help in full too; check the relevant subcommand's `--help` before concluding
that a capability is missing.
Use `environment list <org>.<product> --json` for target IDs and production flags,
without variable values. Check CLI help when using a newly introduced command.
Start long DBD work with `--async`; retain `name` and run `next`. Start/wait/describe
use common top-level fields (`schemaVersion: 1`, `done`, `status`, `version`); legacy
start `metadata` is different from typed wait output. Read full JSON and errors.
Local agent background-task IDs are separate from Alis operation names; stopping a local
wait never cancels server work. Use logs and build cancellation with a matching
CLI/backend release. Diagnose auth, package DNS and platform failures separately.
Direct DBD commands on a known target need no skill discovery. After a plugin update,
restart Codex and start a new thread; `alis doctor --json` reports cache and recent hook observations.
